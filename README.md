Overview of the Project

Project :Vulnerability Scanning Tool
Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a basic vulnerability scanning tool in Python that can scan a target host for open ports and detect outdated software versions based on service banners retrieved from those ports.

key activities:
  Port Discovery
  Service Identification
  Operating System Detection
  Version Detection
  Vulnerability Assessment

Technologies Used:
  TCP/IP Stack: Scanning tools rely heavily on the TCP/IP protocol suite, using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to communicate with ports on target systems
  Socket Programming: Tools often use socket programming to create network connections and send packets to specific ports. This allows them to simulate network traffic and receive responses from the target system.
  Packet Crafting: Some advanced tools can craft specific packets with customized headers to elicit responses from target systems. This is particularly useful for fingerprinting services running on open ports.
  Banner Grabbing: This technique involves capturing and analyzing the banner information sent by services when a connection is established. Banners can reveal the type and version of the service running on a port.

To run the script:
